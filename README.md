# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)


## Overview

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP is a classic optimization problem in the field of computer science and operations research. Given a set of cities and the distances between them, the objective is to find the shortest possible tour that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Genetic Algorithm (GeneticTSP)**
   - Implementation of the TSP solution using a genetic algorithm.

2. **Dynamic Programming (DynamicTSP)**
   - Implementation of the TSP solution using dynamic programming.

3. **Backtracking (BackTSP)**
   - Implementation of the TSP solution using a backtracking approach.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.

### Running the Code

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DaniloDuque/Traveling-Salesman-Problem
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Traveling-Salesman-Problem
    ```

3. Compile the Java files:

    ```bash
    javac Main.java
    ```

4. Run the main program:

    ```bash
    java Main
    ```
